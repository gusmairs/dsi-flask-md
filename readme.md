### Essential Flask-jQuery-Ajax demo  

Simple demo of a web app with Flask running the server and jQuery (JavaScript) running the client side. User gives parameters of a quadratic equation and gets the roots back. Illustrates the essential file structure of a web app driven by Python with no data server on the backend.

To run the demo from the command line:  

`$ export FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development`  
`$ flask run`  

Running in the Flask development environment auto-reloads the server with changes to the code files. The default port is `127.0.0.1:5000`. Use `<Ctrl-C>` in the terminal window to kill the server process.
